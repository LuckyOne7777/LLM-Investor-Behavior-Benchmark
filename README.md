# LLM Investor Behavior Benchmark (LIBB)

## What Is LIBB?

LIBB is an open-source research framework designed to automatically manage portfolio state and compute key metrics,
while still giving users flexibility over the system.

## Why LIBB Exists
This project originally began as a generic benchmark for LLM-based trading in U.S. equities. While surveying existing LLM trading projects (including my own), I noticed a consistent lack of rigorous sentiment, behavioral, and performance metrics; most projects reported little more than an equity curve.

This raised a fundamental question: ***“Why isn’t LLM trading held to the same analytical standards as the rest of finance?”***

Since then, the project has evolved into a high-quality, easy-to-use research framework designed to support more rigorous evaluation of LLM-driven trading systems. The long-term goal is to provide a shared foundation for this work and, ultimately, to establish a community standard for this type of research.
