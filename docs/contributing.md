# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LIBB! Contributions,
discussion, and alternative perspectives are welcome, especially from
those interested in rigorous, transparent research workflows.

To keep the project focused and maintainable, contributions are guided
by the principles outlined below.

---

## Scope of Contributions

LIBB is intentionally aware of its scope and direction.

- **Bug fixes**, documentation improvements, and fixes for existing
  issues are always welcome.
- Improvements that increase correctness, clarity, or reproducibility
  are encouraged.
- Refactors that simplify code or make behavior more explicit are
  generally acceptable when they preserve existing design intent.

---

## Feature Contributions

New features are considered selectively.

- Only **major features that align with items on the project roadmap**
  are likely to be merged.
- Features that fall outside the roadmap should be discussed before
  implementation.
- Contributions that introduce heavy abstraction, rigid workflows, or
  unnecessary dependencies are unlikely to be accepted.

This approach helps ensure the project evolves deliberately rather than
incrementally drifting in scope.

---

## Design Alignment

Before contributing, please review:

- The main README
- The Design Principles documentation
- Important Notes
- Roadmap

Understanding the project’s goals and philosophy will significantly
increase the likelihood that a contribution is accepted.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who consistently provide high-quality, thoughtful
contributions—particularly those that improve reliability, research
value, or design clarity—may be invited to become maintainers.

Maintainers are trusted collaborators who help review contributions,
shape project direction, and uphold core design principles.

---

## General Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and well-scoped
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies
- Document non-obvious behavior or assumptions
- Be respectful and constructive in discussion
- Provide accurate answers to questions

---

## Final Note

LIBB is a research-oriented project. Not all contributions will be
merged, and the decision to decline a proposal does not reflect on the
quality of the idea or the effort involved.

Thoughtful discussion and collaboration are always welcome!
