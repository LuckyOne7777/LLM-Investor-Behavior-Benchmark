US News: Several headlines indicate a mixed but generally positive market environment. The S&P 500 has reached a record close, with specific bullish signals noted for Nvidia and Google. However, futures are moving lower this morning, and there is commentary about a potential tech reset in 2026. Specific negative news includes Plug Power falling despite new milestones.

Price Action & Portfolio Check: The portfolio is currently empty with a cash balance of $10,000. There are no positions to check for stop-loss triggers or price action.

Risk Review: With no holdings, the portfolio has 100% cash exposure and zero market risk or concentration. The primary risk is being out of the market during a period of record highs, potentially missing gains. The mandate requires at least one ticker in the portfolio at all times.

Today's Decision & Rationale: A new position must be initiated to comply with the portfolio rule. Given the conservative, incremental nature of Daily Check Mode and the mixed news (record highs vs. lower futures and tech reset talk), a cautious, foundational entry is warranted. The S&P 500 ETF (SPY) provides broad, diversified market exposure aligned with the index hitting records. I will initiate a small starter position, leaving ample dry powder for future adjustments. The order will be a limit buy slightly below the last close to ensure discipline.
