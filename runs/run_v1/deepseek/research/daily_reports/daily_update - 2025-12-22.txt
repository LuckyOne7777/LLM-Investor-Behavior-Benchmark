US News: The provided headlines indicate a positive start to the shortened trading week, with major US indexes (Dow, Nasdaq) up 0.5%. The market outlook for 2026 is being considered, with notes on volatility and AI capital expenditure. Commodities like gold, silver, and oil saw gains. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic.

Portfolio State: The portfolio is currently empty with a cash balance of $10,000. There are no positions to check for stop-loss triggers or price action.

Risk Review: With no holdings, the portfolio has 100% cash exposure and zero market risk or concentration. The primary risk is being out of the market during a potential uptrend, as suggested by the day's positive price action.

Today's Decision & Rationale: Given the positive market tone from the news and the requirement to have at least one ticker in the portfolio, an initial position will be established. A conservative, broad-market approach is warranted for a new portfolio in daily check mode. Therefore, I will initiate a position in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) to gain diversified exposure to the US large-cap market. The order will be sized to maintain significant dry powder for future adjustments. The limit price is set at a 0.5% premium to the last close to increase the likelihood of execution in an up market, while remaining within the ±10% guideline.
