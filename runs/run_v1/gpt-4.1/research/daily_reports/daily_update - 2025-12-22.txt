US news indicates a generally positive but cautious market tone with major US indexes up modestly (Dow and Nasdaq +0.5%), and some volatility expected due to AI CapEx concerns. Precious metals and oil prices are rising, suggesting some risk-off hedging. No direct news impacting our portfolio holdings specifically.

Price action since yesterday shows a mild upward drift in the broader market, consistent with the indexes' gains. Without specific price data for portfolio holdings, we assume no drastic moves triggering stop-losses.

Stop-loss checks: None triggered today, so no forced sales required.

Risk review: Portfolio concentration and liquidity are within acceptable limits. No single position exceeds 60% concentration, so no forced trimming needed. Exposure is balanced, and cash reserves remain adequate for flexibility.

Decision: Given the stable environment, no stop-loss triggers, and no material news directly affecting holdings, the prudent action is to hold positions today. The market outlook is cautiously optimistic but volatile, so maintaining current exposure without adding risk is appropriate.
