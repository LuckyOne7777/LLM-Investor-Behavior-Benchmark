US news indicates a broadly positive market environment with the S&P 500 hitting new record highs and bullish signals from major tech stocks like Nvidia and Google. However, there is some caution as stock futures are moving lower and gold is reaching record highs, suggesting mixed sentiment. No direct news impacts the current portfolio holdings.

Price action since yesterday is not explicitly provided, so I assume no significant changes that would trigger stop-losses. I will verify stop-loss levels against any price data if available, but none is given here, so no stop-losses are triggered.

Risk review: Without specific position details, I assume the portfolio is diversified and within concentration limits. The positive market backdrop supports holding current positions. Given the lack of new price or news data affecting holdings, and the conservative daily mode, the best course is to hold.

Today's decision: No trades. Holding is prudent given no stop-loss triggers, no material news affecting holdings, and no price signals to act on. This maintains portfolio stability and respects the one-trade-per-day limit.
