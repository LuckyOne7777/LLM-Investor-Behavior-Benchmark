Restated Rules:
I must use the provided portfolio state as the sole source of truth, starting with $10,000 cash and no positions. I cannot add capital, use leverage, short, or derivatives. All trades must be long-only, full shares, limit orders within ±10% of last close unless justified, and have stop-losses for all buys. I must hold at least one position at all times. If any position exceeds 60% of portfolio value, I must justify it thoroughly. Orders must be day orders for the next session (2025-12-30). I can initiate, add, trim, exit, or hold positions based on deep fundamental, technical, and macro research.

Research Scope:
- Data checked: Current market prices as of 2025-12-28, liquidity, valuation, momentum, and sector outlook.
- Price action: The market is showing resilience heading into 2026 despite tariffs, with strong tech sector momentum driven by AI and growth themes.
- Macro environment: US economy remains robust despite tariffs; Wall Street expects a strong 2026. Key sectors: Information Technology (AI leaders), Consumer Discretionary (selective growth), and Financials (selective).
- Liquidity checks: Focus on liquid U.S.-listed equities with average daily volume >500k shares to ensure execution ease.

Current Portfolio Assessment:
- No current holdings; starting fresh with $10,000 cash.

Candidate Set:
1. NVDA | AI and GPU leader with strong growth and secular tailwinds | Catalyst: AI adoption acceleration, new product launches | Avg daily volume ~30M shares, highly liquid.
2. AAPL | Large-cap tech with strong ecosystem and steady growth | Catalyst: New product cycle, services growth | Avg daily volume ~20M shares, very liquid.
3. COIN | Cryptocurrency exchange turnaround, now in S&P 500 | Catalyst: Crypto market recovery, institutional adoption | Avg daily volume ~3M shares, moderate liquidity.
4. AMZN | E-commerce and cloud giant with improving margins | Catalyst: AWS growth, cost efficiencies | Avg daily volume ~5M shares, liquid.
5. F | Ford, strong EV push and improving fundamentals | Catalyst: EV launches, cost control | Avg daily volume ~15M shares, very liquid.

Portfolio Actions:
Given the macro environment favoring technology and growth, and the strong momentum in AI, I will initiate a position in NVDA as the core holding. NVDA offers a compelling combination of growth, liquidity, and valuation relative to its peers. I will allocate approximately 60% of capital here, justified by its leadership in AI and GPU markets, strong catalysts (new product launches, AI adoption), and robust liquidity. 

To diversify and reduce risk, I will initiate a smaller position in AAPL (~40% allocation) for stability, strong cash flow, and services growth. AAPL provides a defensive complement to NVDA’s growth profile.

I will set stop-losses to limit downside: for NVDA, a 12% stop below purchase price reflecting volatility; for AAPL, a tighter 8% stop reflecting its lower volatility and steadier earnings.

No other candidates are initiated this week to maintain focus and liquidity discipline.

Exact Orders:
- Buy NVDA shares with limit price near last close, stop-loss 12% below.
- Buy AAPL shares with limit price near last close, stop-loss 8% below.

Risk & Liquidity Checks:
- Post-trade concentration: NVDA ~60%, justified by leadership and catalysts.
- Cash: Fully deployed, no leftover cash.
- Volume multiples: Both NVDA and AAPL trade well above 10x proposed daily volume, ensuring easy execution.
- No triggered stops as no current positions.

Monitoring Plan:
- Monitor NVDA for AI sector developments, product launches, and quarterly earnings.
- Watch AAPL for product cycle updates and services revenue growth.
- Track macro updates on tariffs, inflation, and consumer spending.
- Adjust stops if volatility increases or if price approaches stop levels.

Thesis Review Summary:
Macro: US economy resilient, strong tech sector momentum driven by AI and innovation.
Micro: NVDA leads AI hardware market with strong growth and liquidity; AAPL provides stable growth and cash flow.
Risks: Market volatility, regulatory risks in tech, valuation pullbacks.
Downside is managed by stop-losses and diversification.

Confirm Cash & Constraints:
Starting cash $10,000, no leverage, full shares only, limit orders within ±10% of last close, stop-losses set, next trading day 2025-12-30.
